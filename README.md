# Introduction<a name = "intro"></a>
My name is [Patrick Moran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-moran-7a349014b/) and this repository contains Functional Programming solutions to 10 Tasks, written in Racket, which are set by our [Lecturer](https://ianmcloughlin.github.io/) throughout the semester. To view the problem sheet containing the tasks click [here](). The following [section](#tasks) contains links to each task; alternatively click [here]().

# Overview <a name="overview"> </a> 

In this module we are given an introduction to Theory of Algorithms, focusing on the areas of computation and computability. Learning outcomes:  
* Compare different models of computation.
* Write computer programs using a selection of programming paradigms.
* Analyse the complexity of an algorithm.
* Identify difficult computational problems in everyday programming.

# Functional Programming<a name = "fp"></a>
Functional Programming is a way of building computer programs that treat computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. 

Some of the core concepts of Functional programming:  
1. Avoid state change and mutable data
2. Keep functions and data seperate
3. Treat functions as first-class citizens

It's declaritive, this means the programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements. During the first three and a half years of college, we have mainly looked at imperative programming e.g. Java. Imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a programâ€™s state. Functional programming is declarative. Declarative programming is a programming paradigm that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow. 

Some common programming languages that support functional programming are Lisp, Scheme, Racket and F#. For these tasks we will be using [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/).
